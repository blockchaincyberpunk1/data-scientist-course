Image Classification with CNN

Objective: To implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

Task:

Introduction to Image Classification and CNN:

Begin by introducing the concept of image classification and the significance of CNNs in image-related tasks.
Explain the importance of CNN layers like convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Dataset Selection:

Provide students with an image classification dataset suitable for the assignment. Suggested datasets include CIFAR-10, MNIST, or a custom dataset.
Ensure the dataset has a sufficient number of classes and a reasonable number of images per class.
Framework Selection:

Instruct students to choose either TensorFlow or PyTorch as their deep learning framework for this assignment.
Model Design and Architecture:

Guide students through the process of designing a CNN model architecture:
a. Define the input layer with appropriate dimensions (image size and channels).
b. Add convolutional layers with different filter sizes and activation functions.
c. Include pooling layers (e.g., max pooling) for down-sampling.
d. Implement fully connected layers for classification.
e. Define the output layer with the appropriate number of units corresponding to the number of classes.
Data Preprocessing:

Explain the importance of data preprocessing, including tasks such as data normalization and data augmentation to enhance model generalization.
Training the CNN:

Instruct students to write code to train their CNN model on the provided dataset.
Specify training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.
Encourage students to monitor training progress by visualizing metrics (e.g., loss and accuracy) using appropriate tools or libraries.
Evaluation and Testing:

Have students evaluate the trained CNN model's performance on a separate test dataset.
Calculate classification accuracy and visualize model predictions on test images.
Experimentation and Optimization:

Encourage students to experiment with different hyperparameters and model architectures to improve classification performance.
Documentation and Code Submission:

Assign students the task of documenting their CNN model implementation, including explanations and comments.
Have them submit their code and documentation for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of a CNN model for image classification using the chosen deep learning framework.
Appropriate data preprocessing and data augmentation techniques.
Successful training and evaluation of the CNN model on the provided dataset.
Proper documentation of the code, including explanations and comments.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Experimentation with hyperparameters and an understanding of their impact on model performance.
