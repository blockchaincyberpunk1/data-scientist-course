Deep Learning Framework Introduction

Objective: To explore deep learning frameworks.

Task:

Introduction to Deep Learning Frameworks:

Provide an introduction to deep learning frameworks, focusing on their significance in machine learning and neural network development.
Explain the choice between TensorFlow and PyTorch as the two primary frameworks for this assignment.
Framework Selection:

Instruct students to choose one of the deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow or PyTorch) based on their preference or prior experience.
Basic Operations and Neural Network Architecture:

Guide students through the following tasks:
a. Installation of the chosen deep learning framework.
b. Creating a Python script to define a small neural network architecture. The architecture should include input, hidden, and output layers.
c. Specifying activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid) for the layers.
d. Implementing forward and backward passes for the network.
e. Defining a loss function (e.g., cross-entropy) and an optimization algorithm (e.g., stochastic gradient descent).
Sample Dataset:

Provide students with a sample dataset suitable for a binary classification task. The dataset should be simple enough to facilitate learning but meaningful for training a neural network.
Training the Neural Network:

Instruct students to write code for training the neural network on the provided dataset.
Define training parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.
Evaluation and Performance Metrics:

Have students evaluate the trained neural network's performance on the validation dataset.
Calculate relevant metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Documentation and Code Submission:

Assign students the task of documenting their deep learning framework code, including explanations and comments.
Instruct them to submit their code and documentation for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of a neural network using the chosen deep learning framework.
Accurate forward and backward pass implementations.
Successful training and evaluation of the network on the provided dataset.
Proper documentation of the code, including explanations and comments.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Understanding of hyperparameters and their impact on model performance.
