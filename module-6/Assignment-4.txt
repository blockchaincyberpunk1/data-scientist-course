Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for Sequence Data

Objective: To work with sequence data using RNNs.

Task:

Introduction to Sequence Data and RNNs:

Begin by introducing the concept of sequence data and its applications, such as time series forecasting and text generation.
Explain the significance of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling sequential data.
Dataset Selection:

Provide students with a sequence dataset suitable for the assignment. Examples include time series data (e.g., stock prices) or text data (e.g., Shakespearean text).
Ensure the dataset is diverse and has enough data points for training and testing.
Framework Selection:

Instruct students to choose either TensorFlow or PyTorch as their deep learning framework for this assignment.
RNN Model Design and Architecture:

Guide students through the process of designing an RNN model architecture:
a. Define the input layer with appropriate dimensions (sequence length and input features).
b. Add one or more RNN layers (e.g., LSTM or GRU) to capture sequential patterns.
c. Implement fully connected layers for prediction.
d. Define the output layer based on the specific task (e.g., regression or classification).
Data Preprocessing:

Explain the importance of data preprocessing for sequence data, including tasks such as sequence padding and feature scaling.
Training the RNN:

Instruct students to write code to train their RNN model on the provided sequence dataset.
Specify training parameters, including learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs.
Evaluation and Testing:

Have students evaluate the trained RNN model's performance on a separate validation dataset.
Calculate relevant evaluation metrics based on the specific task (e.g., Mean Absolute Error for regression or accuracy for classification).
Sequence Data Generation (Optional):

For text-based tasks, encourage students to use their trained RNN model to generate text sequences (e.g., sentences or paragraphs) and discuss the results.
Experimentation and Optimization:

Encourage students to experiment with different hyperparameters, RNN architectures (e.g., stacked RNNs), and optimization techniques to improve model performance.
Documentation and Code Submission:

Assign students the task of documenting their RNN model implementation, including explanations and comments.
Have them submit their code and documentation for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of an RNN model for sequence data using the chosen deep learning framework.
Appropriate data preprocessing for sequence data.
Successful training and evaluation of the RNN model on the provided sequence dataset.
Proper documentation of the code, including explanations and comments.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Experimentation with hyperparameters and an understanding of their impact on model performance.
