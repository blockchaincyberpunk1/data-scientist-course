Neural Network Basics

Objective: To understand the basics of neural networks.

Task:

Introduction to Neural Networks:

Provide an introduction to neural networks, emphasizing their structure, components (neurons and layers), and the concept of feedforward networks.
Dataset Selection:

Assign students a simple dataset suitable for binary classification, such as the XOR problem. The dataset should have a clear separation between classes.
Neural Network Implementation:

Instruct students to implement a feedforward neural network from scratch using Python and the NumPy library.
The network should consist of:
An input layer with the appropriate number of neurons based on the dataset's features.
At least one hidden layer with a configurable number of neurons.
An output layer with a single neuron for binary classification.
Encourage students to implement activation functions (e.g., sigmoid or ReLU) for the hidden layer and a sigmoid activation function for the output layer.
Dataset Preprocessing:

Guide students in preprocessing the dataset, including data normalization or scaling if necessary.
Forward Propagation:

Explain the forward propagation process and how to calculate predictions using the implemented network.
Loss Function and Backpropagation:

Teach students about loss functions (e.g., mean squared error or binary cross-entropy) and the concept of backpropagation.
Instruct them on how to update the network's weights and biases using gradient descent.
Training the Network:

Instruct students to train the neural network using the provided dataset.
They should define hyperparameters such as learning rate, the number of hidden layer neurons, and the number of training epochs.
Evaluation and Validation:

Have students evaluate the trained neural network's performance on both the training and validation datasets.
Calculate relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Experimentation and Tuning:

Encourage students to experiment with different hyperparameter settings to observe how they affect the network's performance.
Documentation and Code Submission:

Assign students the task of documenting their neural network implementation, including the network architecture, training process, and results.
Have them submit their code and documentation for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct implementation of a feedforward neural network from scratch.
Proper dataset preprocessing and handling.
Accurate forward propagation and backpropagation implementation.
Successful training and evaluation of the network on the provided dataset.
Clear documentation of the code, including explanations and comments.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Experimentation with hyperparameters and an understanding of their impact on model performance.
