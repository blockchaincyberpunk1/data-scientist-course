Predictive Analytics Project

Objective: To work on a predictive analytics project.

Task:

Introduction to Predictive Analytics:

Begin by introducing the concept of predictive analytics and its significance in various domains.
Explain the goal of the assignment, which is to build a predictive model using a real-world dataset.
Dataset Selection:

Provide students with a real-world dataset that is relevant to the predictive task you want them to perform (e.g., customer churn prediction, stock price forecasting).
Emphasize the importance of data quality and data preprocessing.
Problem Statement:

Clearly define the predictive task. For example, if it's customer churn prediction, specify what constitutes churn and the business implications.
Provide context on why solving this problem is valuable.
Data Exploration and Analysis:

Instruct students to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset. This should include summary statistics, data visualization, and identification of any data issues.
Encourage students to uncover insights and trends in the data that may be relevant to the predictive task.
Feature Engineering:

Explain the importance of feature engineering in building effective predictive models.
Guide students in selecting and engineering features from the dataset to improve model performance.
Model Selection:

Introduce students to different predictive modeling techniques such as regression, classification, time series forecasting, etc.
Have them choose an appropriate model for the task and justify their selection.
Data Splitting:

Instruct students to split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Emphasize the need to avoid data leakage and maintain proper validation procedures.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Guide students through the process of training the selected model on the training dataset.
Instruct them to evaluate the model using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, RMSE) and provide interpretations of the results.
Model Interpretability:

Encourage students to make their models interpretable by using techniques such as feature importance analysis and SHAP values.
Report and Insights:

Require students to compile their findings and results into a comprehensive report.
The report should include data visualizations, insights, model performance metrics, and any actionable recommendations based on the analysis.
Presentation (Optional):

Optionally, you can ask students to present their predictive analytics projects to the class or submit recorded presentations.
Code and Documentation Submission:

Have students submit their code (Python or R) along with the project report and any visualizations.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Proper data analysis and exploration techniques.
Effective feature engineering and model selection.
Appropriate model evaluation and interpretation of results.
Clear and comprehensive project report with insights.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and model interpretability.
