Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project

Objective: To apply NLP techniques to a real-world problem.

Task:

Introduction to NLP:

Begin by introducing the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and its relevance in various applications such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and named entity recognition.
Explain the goal of the assignment, which is to build an NLP model and create a functional NLP application.
Dataset Selection:

Provide students with a text dataset that is relevant to the NLP task you want them to perform (e.g., movie reviews for sentiment analysis, news articles for text classification).
Emphasize the importance of data preprocessing in NLP tasks.
Problem Statement:

Clearly define the NLP task. For example, if it's sentiment analysis, specify what constitutes positive and negative sentiment and the potential applications of sentiment analysis.
Data Preprocessing:

Instruct students to perform data preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization or stemming.
Explain the significance of data preprocessing in improving the quality of NLP models.
Model Selection:

Introduce students to different NLP techniques and models, such as bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec), and neural networks (e.g., LSTM or Transformer-based models).
Have them choose an appropriate model for the NLP task and justify their selection.
Model Implementation:

Guide students through the implementation of the selected NLP model using libraries like NLTK, spaCy, or TensorFlow/Keras.
Instruct them to train the model on the preprocessed text data.
Functional Application:

Encourage students to build a functional NLP application around the trained model. For example, they can create a sentiment analysis tool that takes user input and provides sentiment predictions.
Model Evaluation:

Instruct students to evaluate the performance of their NLP model using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Emphasize the need for proper validation and testing procedures.
Report and Documentation:

Require students to document their NLP project in a comprehensive report. The report should include details on data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and application functionality.
Presentation (Optional):

Optionally, you can ask students to present their NLP projects to the class or submit recorded presentations.
Code Submission:

Have students submit their code (Python or other relevant language) along with the project report and any documentation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Proper data preprocessing and text cleaning techniques.
Effective model selection and implementation.
Appropriate model evaluation and interpretation of results.
Functional NLP application with user interaction.
Clear and comprehensive project report with details on the NLP model and application.
