Model Selection

Objective: To select the best model for a given problem.

Task:

Introduction to Model Selection:

Provide an introduction to the importance of model selection in machine learning and its impact on the quality of predictions.
Dataset Selection:

Assign students a set of diverse datasets, each with different characteristics (e.g., size, features, target variable types).
Algorithm List:

Provide a list of machine learning algorithms that students can choose from (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine).
Dataset Exploration:

Instruct students to explore each dataset, including data distributions, feature types, and any potential issues like class imbalance or missing values.
Model Selection Process:

Explain the steps involved in the model selection process:
a. For each dataset, students should:
Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm from the provided list.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, mean squared error).
b. Repeat the process for each dataset, ensuring that they document the chosen algorithm and its performance on each dataset.
Model Comparison:

Instruct students to compare the performance of different algorithms across datasets. They should identify which algorithms perform best on which types of datasets and discuss reasons for their choices.
Presentation or Report:

Assign students the task of creating a presentation or report summarizing their model selection process. The presentation should include explanations of dataset characteristics, algorithm choices, model performance metrics, and insights gained from the comparison.
Submission of Model Selection Project:

Have students submit their presentations or reports for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Proper dataset exploration and understanding of dataset characteristics.
Appropriate selection of machine learning algorithms for each dataset.
Accurate model training and evaluation on the testing set.
Clear and well-reasoned explanations for algorithm choices.
Insightful comparisons of model performance across datasets.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Overall organization and clarity of the presentation or report.
