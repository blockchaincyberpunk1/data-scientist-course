Dimensionality Reduction

Objective: To explore dimensionality reduction.

Task:

Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction:

Provide an introduction to dimensionality reduction in machine learning, explaining its significance in reducing the complexity of high-dimensional datasets.
Dataset Selection:

Assign students a high-dimensional dataset suitable for dimensionality reduction. The dataset should have a significant number of features.
Dataset Exploration:

Instruct students to explore the dataset, including data distributions, the number of features, and any potential issues like missing values.
Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:

Introduce students to dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).
Explain the principles and applications of each technique.
Implementing Dimensionality Reduction:

Instruct students to choose one dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) and implement it using a machine learning library like scikit-learn (Python) or R.
Visualization:

Have students create visualizations to display the results of dimensionality reduction. This may include scatter plots or heatmaps showing the reduced data.
Interpretation:

Instruct students to interpret the results of dimensionality reduction. They should discuss the reduced features, variance explained, and any insights gained.
Comparison (Optional):

Optionally, students can explore and compare the results of multiple dimensionality reduction techniques.
Report or Presentation:

Assign students the task of creating a report or presentation summarizing their dimensionality reduction implementation, including data preprocessing, selection of dimensionality reduction technique, visualization, and interpretation of results.
Submission of Dimensionality Reduction Project:

Have students submit their reports or presentations for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Proper data preprocessing (if needed).
Correct implementation of the chosen dimensionality reduction technique.
Quality of visualizations and interpretation of reduced data.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Overall organization and clarity of the report or presentation.
