K-Means Clustering

Objective: To practice K-Means clustering.

Task:

Introduction to Clustering:

Provide an introduction to clustering in machine learning, emphasizing the purpose of grouping data points with similar characteristics.
Dataset Selection:

Assign students a dataset suitable for a clustering task. The dataset should have features suitable for K-Means clustering.
Dataset Exploration:

Instruct students to explore the dataset, including data distributions, feature types (numeric), and any potential issues like missing values.
Data Preprocessing (if needed):

Guide students through data preprocessing steps, such as scaling or standardization, if necessary for the clustering algorithm.
K-Means Algorithm Explanation:

Explain the K-Means clustering algorithm, including how it works and the concept of centroids.
Implementing K-Means:

Instruct students to implement the K-Means clustering algorithm using a machine learning library like scikit-learn (Python) or kmeans (R).
Encourage them to start with an initial assumption of the number of clusters (K).
Determining the Optimal Number of Clusters (K):

Introduce techniques for determining the optimal number of clusters, such as the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.
Instruct students to apply these techniques to select the most appropriate K value for their dataset.
Visualization:

Have students create visualizations to display the results of K-Means clustering. This may include scatter plots with cluster assignments.
Interpretation:

Instruct students to interpret the results of the clustering. They should discuss the characteristics of each cluster and any insights gained.
Report or Presentation:

Assign students the task of creating a report or presentation summarizing their K-Means clustering implementation, including data preprocessing, model implementation, determination of the optimal number of clusters, visualization, and interpretation of results.
Submission of K-Means Clustering Project:

Have students submit their reports or presentations for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Proper data preprocessing (if needed).
Correct implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
Accurate determination of the optimal number of clusters.
Quality of visualizations and interpretation of cluster assignments.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Overall organization and clarity of the report or presentation.
