Random Forest Implementation

Objective: To implement a Random Forest classifier.

Task:

Introduction to Random Forest:

Provide an introduction to Random Forest as an ensemble learning method in machine learning, explaining its advantages and applications.
Dataset Selection:

Assign students a classification dataset suitable for training a Random Forest classifier. The dataset should include both features and labeled target variables.
Dataset Exploration:

Instruct students to explore the dataset, including data distributions, feature types, and any potential issues like class imbalance or missing values.
Implementing a Single Decision Tree:

Before introducing Random Forest, guide students in implementing a single decision tree classifier using Python's scikit-learn library.
Instruct them to train the tree-based classifier and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
Introduction to Random Forest:

Explain the concept of ensemble learning and how Random Forest combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Implementing Random Forest:

Instruct students to implement a Random Forest classifier using scikit-learn. They should train the Random Forest model on the same dataset used for the single decision tree.
Model Evaluation:

Encourage students to evaluate the Random Forest classifier's performance using the same evaluation metrics used for the single decision tree.
Comparison:

Have students compare the performance of the Random Forest classifier to that of the single decision tree.
Discuss the benefits of ensemble methods and why Random Forest outperforms a single decision tree in many cases.
Report or Presentation:

Assign students the task of creating a report or presentation summarizing their Random Forest implementation, including data preprocessing, single decision tree implementation, Random Forest implementation, model evaluation, and comparison.
Submission of Random Forest Project:

Have students submit their reports or presentations for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Proper data preprocessing (if needed).
Correct implementation of a single decision tree and Random Forest classifier.
Accurate model training and evaluation.
Clear comparison between the two models, highlighting the advantages of Random Forest.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and interpretation.
Overall organization and clarity of the report or presentation.
