Interactive Data Dashboard

Objective: To build an interactive data dashboard.

Task:

Introduction to Interactive Data Dashboards:

Provide an introduction to the importance of interactive data dashboards in data analysis and communication.
Explain how interactive features can enhance user engagement and data exploration.
Dataset Selection:

Instruct students to select a dataset for their interactive dashboard project. The dataset should be relevant to their interests or field of study and suitable for creating a dashboard.
Dashboard Tools and Programming Language:

Let students choose a programming language and tool for creating the interactive dashboard. Common choices include Python with Plotly Dash or R with Shiny.
Provide guidance on how to set up the chosen tool and import any necessary libraries.
Data Exploration:

Instruct students to load and explore the chosen dataset. They should identify key variables, potential insights, and user interactions that would be valuable for their dashboard.
Dashboard Design and Layout:

Assign students the task of designing the layout and interface of their interactive dashboard. They should consider the following:
Selecting appropriate visualization components (charts, graphs, tables).
Designing a user-friendly interface with labels and instructions.
Adding interactive elements like dropdowns, filters, or buttons for user interaction.
Organizing the dashboard into sections or tabs for clarity.
Dashboard Development:

Guide students through the process of developing the interactive dashboard using their chosen tool. They should create the necessary components, connect data to visualizations, and implement interactivity.
User Testing (Optional):

If time allows, students can conduct user testing by sharing their dashboard with peers or volunteers to gather feedback on usability and effectiveness.
Documentation:

Require students to document the dashboard development process, including any challenges faced and how they were overcome, as well as insights or findings from the data.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their interactive data dashboards to the class, demonstrating how to use the dashboard and highlighting key insights.
Submission of Interactive Data Dashboard:

Have students submit their interactive data dashboard project, including the code, dataset, documentation, and any user testing feedback.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Usability and user-friendliness of the interactive dashboard.
Effectiveness of interactive features for data exploration.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Creativity and customization in dashboard design.
Ethical considerations related to data representation and privacy.
Overall presentation and clarity of the dashboard.
