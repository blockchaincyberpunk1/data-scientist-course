Hypothesis Testing

Objective: To perform hypothesis testing.

Task:

Introduction to Hypothesis Testing:

Provide an introduction to the concept of hypothesis testing in statistical analysis.
Explain the importance of hypothesis testing in drawing conclusions from data.
Dataset Selection:

Instruct students to select a dataset for their hypothesis testing project. The dataset should be relevant to their research question and suitable for hypothesis testing.
Research Question Formulation:

Guide students in formulating a research question that can be addressed through hypothesis testing. Encourage them to define null and alternative hypotheses based on their research question.
Programming Language:

Let students choose a programming language for conducting hypothesis testing. Common choices are Python with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, or R.
Data Exploration:

Instruct students to load and explore the chosen dataset. They should identify the variables of interest and understand their distributions.
Statistical Test Selection:

Assign students the task of choosing an appropriate statistical test for their research question. Examples of tests include:
Independent t-test (for comparing means of two groups).
Chi-squared test (for testing independence in contingency tables).
ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) (for comparing means across multiple groups).
Hypothesis Testing Process:

Guide students through the steps of conducting hypothesis testing, which typically include:
Formulating null and alternative hypotheses.
Choosing the significance level (alpha).
Calculating the test statistic.
Determining the p-value.
Making a decision to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
Interpreting the results in the context of the research question.
Visualization (Optional):

If time allows, students can create visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots) to help illustrate the distribution of data and the results of hypothesis testing.
Documentation:

Require students to document their hypothesis testing process, including the research question, hypotheses, chosen statistical test, results, and interpretation.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their hypothesis testing project to the class, explaining the research question, methodology, and findings.
Submission of Hypothesis Testing Project:

Have students submit their hypothesis testing project, including the code, dataset, documentation, and any visualizations (if created).
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and relevance of the research question.
Appropriateness of the chosen statistical test.
Correctness of hypothesis testing methodology.
Interpretation of results in the context of the research question.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Ethical considerations related to data analysis and interpretation.
Overall presentation and clarity of the project.
