Probability and Hypothesis Testing

Objective: To apply probability and hypothesis testing.

Task:

Introduction to Probability and Hypothesis Testing:

Provide an introduction to the concepts of probability and hypothesis testing in statistics.
Explain how hypothesis testing helps in making informed decisions based on data.
Hypothesis Testing Problem:

Present students with a real-world problem or scenario that requires hypothesis testing. The problem should involve comparing two groups or populations.
Formulating Null and Alternative Hypotheses:

Instruct students to formulate null (H0) and alternative (Ha) hypotheses for the problem. Ensure that the hypotheses are clear and relevant to the problem statement.
Data Collection:

Provide students with the dataset relevant to the problem. The dataset should contain the necessary information to perform the hypothesis test.
Data Exploration:

Ask students to load and explore the dataset using Python (using libraries like pandas) or R. They should examine the characteristics of the data, including sample sizes and data distributions.
Hypothesis Testing:

Assign students the task of selecting an appropriate hypothesis test (e.g., t-test, chi-squared test, ANOVA) based on the problem and data type.
Instruct them to perform the hypothesis test using Python (e.g., scipy.stats) or R (e.g., t.test, chisq.test).
Calculating p-values:

Have students calculate the p-value associated with the test statistic. This is a critical step in hypothesis testing, as it quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis.
Interpretation of Results:

Instruct students to interpret the results of the hypothesis test. They should address the following questions:
What does the p-value indicate about the null hypothesis?
Can the null hypothesis be rejected or not?
What are the practical implications of the test results?
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their hypothesis testing process, results, and interpretations to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Reflection:

Encourage students to reflect on the process of hypothesis testing and its relevance in data-driven decision-making.
Submission of Analysis:

Have students submit their analysis, including code (Python or R scripts), hypothesis statements, test statistics, p-values, and interpretations.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correct formulation of null and alternative hypotheses.
Appropriate selection and execution of the hypothesis test.
Accurate calculation of p-values.
Clarity and relevance of the interpretation of results.
Quality of code and documentation.
Overall presentation and clarity of the analysis.
