Outlier Detection and Removal

Objective: To identify and handle outliers.

Task:

Introduction to Outlier Detection and Removal:

Provide an introduction to the concept of outliers in data and their impact on statistical analysis and modeling.
Explain how outlier detection and removal are essential steps in data preprocessing.
Dataset with Outliers:

Provide students with a dataset that contains outliers. Ensure that the dataset has a mix of data types (numeric and categorical) and that the outliers are spread across different columns.
Python Libraries:

Introduce students to Python libraries commonly used for data analysis and outlier detection, such as pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Provide guidance on how to import these libraries.
Data Exploration:

Instruct students to load the dataset using pandas and start by exploring the dataset's structure. They should identify columns with potential outliers and understand the data types.
Outlier Detection Methods:

Assign students the task of writing Python code to detect outliers using appropriate methods, such as:
Z-score method.
IQR (Interquartile Range) method.
Visualization techniques (box plots or scatter plots) to identify potential outliers.
Outlier Handling:

Instruct students to decide on an approach for handling outliers based on their detection method:
Removal of outliers (students should clearly document their criteria for removal).
Transformation of outlier values (e.g., capping or transforming outliers).
Imputation of outliers using statistical techniques (e.g., replacing with the mean or median).
Data Validation:

Encourage students to validate their dataset after handling outliers to ensure that the process has been executed correctly. They should check for the absence of extreme values.
Documentation:

Require students to document their outlier detection and handling process, including which method(s) were used, and any challenges or observations during the process.
Analysis (Optional):

If time allows, students can perform basic data analysis or visualization using the cleaned dataset to understand the impact of outlier handling on analysis results.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their outlier detection and handling process, challenges, and results to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Submission of Cleaned Dataset and Documentation:

Have students submit the cleaned dataset (with outliers handled) and the documentation of their outlier detection and handling process.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and effectiveness of outlier detection and handling techniques.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Quality of code for outlier detection and handling.
Validation of the cleaned dataset to ensure correctness.
Ethical considerations related to outlier handling.
Overall presentation and clarity of the process.
