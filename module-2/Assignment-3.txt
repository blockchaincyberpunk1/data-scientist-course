Missing Data Handling

Objective: To practice handling missing values.

Task:

Introduction to Missing Data Handling:

Provide an introduction to the importance of handling missing values in data analysis and data preprocessing.
Explain how missing data can impact the accuracy and validity of analysis results.
Dataset with Missing Values:

Provide students with a dataset that contains missing values. Ensure that the dataset has a mix of data types (numeric and categorical) and that the missing values are spread across different columns.
Python Libraries:

Introduce students to Python libraries commonly used for data analysis and handling missing values, such as pandas and NumPy. Provide guidance on how to import these libraries.
Data Exploration:

Instruct students to load the dataset using pandas and start by exploring the dataset's structure. They should identify columns with missing values and understand the data types.
Missing Data Imputation:

Assign students the task of writing Python code to handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques. They should consider the following methods:
Mean or median imputation for numeric columns.
Mode imputation for categorical columns.
Interpolation techniques (e.g., linear interpolation) for time-series or continuous data.
Advanced techniques like K-nearest neighbors (KNN) imputation, if applicable.
Data Validation:

Encourage students to validate their imputed data to ensure that the imputation process has been executed correctly. They should check for missing values after imputation.
Documentation:

Require students to document their missing data handling process, including which imputation techniques were used for each column, and any challenges or observations during the process.
Analysis (Optional):

If time allows, students can perform basic data analysis or visualization using the cleaned dataset to understand the impact of missing data handling on analysis results.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their missing data handling process, challenges, and results to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Submission of Cleaned Dataset and Documentation:

Have students submit the cleaned dataset (with missing values imputed) and the documentation of their missing data handling process.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and effectiveness of missing data handling techniques.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Quality of code for imputation.
Validation of imputed data to ensure correctness.
Ethical considerations related to data handling.
Overall presentation and clarity of the process.
