Data API Integration

Objective: To work with data APIs.

Task:

Introduction to Data API Integration:

Provide an introduction to the concept of data API integration and its significance in accessing and retrieving data from external sources.
Explain how APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow applications to communicate with each other and access data.
API Selection:

Instruct students to choose a public API that is relevant to their interests or field of study. It could be a weather data API, social media API, financial data API, or any other suitable source. Help them find APIs with available documentation.
API Key (if required):

If the selected API requires an API key for authentication, guide students on how to obtain and use it.
Python Libraries:

Introduce students to Python libraries for making API requests, such as requests. Provide guidance on how to install and import these libraries.
API Request and Data Retrieval:

Assign students the task of writing a Python script that interacts with the selected API. The script should:
Make API requests to retrieve data.
Handle response data, which is typically in JSON format.
Extract relevant information from the response.
Data Storage:

Instruct students to save the retrieved data in a structured format for further analysis. They can save it to a CSV, JSON, or a database, depending on the data's nature.
Data Analysis (Optional):

If time allows, encourage students to perform basic data analysis or visualization using the retrieved data. They can use Python libraries like pandas or Matplotlib for this purpose.
Error Handling:

Emphasize the importance of error handling in API integration. Instruct students to implement error-handling mechanisms to manage situations such as network errors or API rate limits.
Documentation:

Require students to document their API integration process, including the API used, the purpose of data retrieval, the structure of the data, and any challenges faced during integration.
Ethical Considerations:

Discuss ethical considerations related to API usage, including respecting rate limits, terms of service, and data privacy.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their API integration process, challenges, and results to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Submission of API Integration Script and Documentation:

Have students submit their API integration script, retrieved data, and documentation as part of their assignment.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effectiveness of the API integration script in retrieving data.
Handling of common API challenges and errors.
Ethical considerations and adherence to API usage guidelines.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Quality of code and error handling.
Overall presentation and clarity of the process.
