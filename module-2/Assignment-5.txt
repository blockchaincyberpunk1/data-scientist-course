Data Scaling and Transformation

Objective: To perform data scaling and transformation.

Task:

Introduction to Data Scaling and Transformation:

Provide an introduction to the importance of data scaling and transformation in the context of machine learning.
Explain how these preprocessing steps can help improve the performance of machine learning models.
Dataset:

Provide students with a dataset that requires scaling and transformation. Ensure that the dataset contains a mix of numeric features, including both continuous and discrete variables.
Python Libraries:

Introduce students to Python libraries commonly used for data preprocessing, such as pandas and scikit-learn. Provide guidance on how to import these libraries.
Data Exploration:

Instruct students to load the dataset using pandas and explore its structure. They should identify the features that require scaling and transformation and understand their data distributions.
Data Scaling and Transformation Techniques:

Assign students the task of writing Python code to apply the following techniques to the dataset:
Min-Max scaling: Scaling numeric features to a specific range, often [0, 1].
Log transformation: Applying a logarithmic transformation to features with skewed distributions.
Standardization (optional): Standardizing features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Scaling and Transformation Process:

Guide students on how to implement the chosen techniques. They should apply these techniques to the appropriate features in the dataset.
Data Validation:

Encourage students to validate their scaled and transformed dataset to ensure that the preprocessing steps have been executed correctly. They should check the summary statistics and distributions of features.
Documentation:

Require students to document their data scaling and transformation process, including which techniques were applied to which features, and any challenges or observations during the process.
Analysis (Optional):

If time allows, students can perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) or visualization using the scaled and transformed dataset to understand the impact on feature distributions.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their data scaling and transformation process, challenges, and results to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Submission of Preprocessed Dataset and Documentation:

Have students submit the preprocessed dataset (scaled and transformed) and the documentation of their data preprocessing process.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and effectiveness of data scaling and transformation techniques.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Quality of code for preprocessing.
Validation of the preprocessed dataset to ensure correctness.
Ethical considerations related to data preprocessing.
Overall presentation and clarity of the process.
