Web Scraping with Python

Objective: To practice web scraping techniques.

Task:

Introduction to Web Scraping:

Provide an introduction to the concept of web scraping and its applications in data collection.
Explain how web scraping involves extracting data from websites for various purposes, including data analysis and research.
Website Selection:

Instruct students to choose a real website for web scraping. They should select a website that contains data of interest and is publicly accessible. It could be a news website, e-commerce site, blog, or any other suitable source.
Data Identification:

Ask students to identify the specific data they want to extract from the chosen website. They should determine the HTML structure and elements that contain the target data.
Python Libraries:

Introduce students to Python libraries commonly used for web scraping, such as Beautiful Soup and Requests. Provide guidance on how to install and import these libraries.
Web Scraping Script:

Assign students the task of writing a Python script that performs web scraping on the selected website. The script should:
Use the Requests library to fetch the web page's HTML content.
Use Beautiful Soup to parse the HTML and extract the desired data.
Store the extracted data in a structured format, such as a CSV or JSON file.
Handling Challenges:

Prepare students for common challenges in web scraping, such as handling pagination, dealing with dynamic websites, and avoiding web scraping etiquette violations (e.g., respecting robots.txt).
Data Validation:

Encourage students to validate the scraped data to ensure accuracy and consistency. They should check for missing or corrupted data.
Documentation:

Require students to document their web scraping process, including the website URL, data to be extracted, the structure of the data, and any challenges encountered during scraping.
Ethical Considerations:

Emphasize the importance of ethical web scraping. Instruct students to respect website terms of service, avoid overloading servers with requests, and obtain necessary permissions when scraping sensitive or private data.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their web scraping process, challenges, and results to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Submission of Web Scraping Script and Documentation:

Have students submit their web scraping script, extracted data, and documentation as part of their assignment.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Effectiveness of web scraping script in extracting the desired data.
Handling of common web scraping challenges.
Ethical considerations and adherence to best practices.
Clarity and completeness of documentation.
Quality of code and error handling.
Overall presentation and clarity of the process.
