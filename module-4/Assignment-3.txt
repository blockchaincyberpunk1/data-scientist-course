Feature Selection

Objective: To practice feature selection.

Task:

Introduction to Feature Selection:

Provide an introduction to the importance of feature selection in machine learning.
Explain that feature selection helps improve model performance, reduce complexity, and enhance interpretability.
Dataset Selection:

Assign students a dataset for analysis. The dataset should contain multiple features (attributes) and a target variable suitable for a machine learning task.
Dataset Exploration:

Instruct students to explore the dataset, including data distributions, feature types (numeric, categorical), and any potential issues like missing values or outliers.
Feature Selection Techniques:

Introduce students to common feature selection techniques, such as:
Correlation Analysis: Identify and remove highly correlated features.
Feature Importance: Calculate feature importance scores using methods like tree-based models (e.g., Random Forest) and select the most important features.
Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Use RFE to iteratively select features based on model performance.
Feature Selection Process:

Guide students through the process of feature selection. They should apply at least two feature selection techniques to the dataset.
Justification:

Instruct students to justify their selection of features based on the techniques they applied. They should explain why certain features were chosen or removed.
Model Building:

Have students build machine learning models using the selected features and compare model performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, mean squared error) with and without feature selection.
Evaluation Metrics:

Explain the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics for the machine learning task and dataset. Students should identify the relevant metrics for their problem.
Report or Presentation:

Assign students the task of creating a report or presentation summarizing their feature selection process, techniques applied, justifications, and the impact on model performance.
Submission of Feature Selection Project:

Have students submit their reports or presentations for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Application of feature selection techniques.
Clarity and completeness of explanations and justifications.
Comparison of model performance before and after feature selection.
Appropriate selection of evaluation metrics.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and feature selection.
Overall organization and clarity of the report or presentation.
