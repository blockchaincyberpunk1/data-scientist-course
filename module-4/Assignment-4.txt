Feature Transformation

Objective: To explore feature transformation techniques.

Task:

Introduction to Feature Transformation:

Provide an introduction to the concept of feature transformation in machine learning.
Explain that feature transformation involves modifying or encoding features to make them suitable for machine learning algorithms.
Dataset Selection:

Assign students a dataset for analysis. The dataset should contain a mix of numeric and categorical features.
Dataset Exploration:

Instruct students to explore the dataset, including data distributions, feature types (numeric, categorical), and any potential issues like missing values.
Feature Transformation Techniques:

Introduce students to common feature transformation techniques, including:
Feature Scaling: Explain methods such as Min-Max scaling and Z-score standardization.
Categorical Variable Encoding: Describe techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding for handling categorical variables.
Interaction Features: Illustrate how to create interaction features by combining two or more existing features.
Feature Transformation Process:

Guide students through the process of feature transformation. They should apply each of the mentioned techniques to the dataset.
Justification:

Instruct students to justify their use of each feature transformation technique. They should explain why a specific technique was applied to a particular feature.
Model Building:

Have students build machine learning models using the transformed features and compare model performance (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, mean squared error) with and without feature transformation.
Evaluation Metrics:

Explain the importance of selecting appropriate evaluation metrics for the machine learning task and dataset. Students should identify the relevant metrics for their problem.
Report or Presentation:

Assign students the task of creating a report or presentation summarizing their feature transformation process, techniques applied, justifications, and the impact on model performance.
Submission of Feature Transformation Project:

Have students submit their reports or presentations for evaluation.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Application of feature transformation techniques.
Clarity and completeness of explanations and justifications.
Comparison of model performance before and after feature transformation.
Appropriate selection of evaluation metrics.
Ethical considerations related to data usage and feature transformation.
Overall organization and clarity of the report or presentation.
