Model Containerization with Docker

Objective: To containerize a machine learning model using Docker.

Task:

In this assignment, students will learn how to containerize a machine learning model using Docker, a popular containerization platform. They will create a Docker image that encapsulates the machine learning model, its dependencies, and a simple web service to interact with the model.

Instructions:

Introduction to Containerization:

Provide an overview of containerization and its significance in deploying machine learning models.
Explain the advantages of using Docker for packaging models.
Select a Machine Learning Model:

Provide students with a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., a classification or regression model).
Ensure that the model is suitable for containerization.
Install Docker:

Instruct students to install Docker on their local development environment.
Provide resources or guides for Docker installation.
Dockerfile Creation:

Explain the concept of a Dockerfile and its role in defining the container's configuration.
Instruct students to create a Dockerfile for their project.
Model Integration:

Guide students in embedding the pre-trained machine learning model within the Docker image.
Explain how to include model weights, code, and dependencies.
Web Service:

Encourage students to create a basic web service (e.g., using Flask) within the Docker container.
The web service should expose an API endpoint for model predictions.
Docker Compose (Optional):

Introduce Docker Compose for orchestrating multi-container applications.
If desired, students can use Docker Compose to manage the model container and any additional services.
Building and Running the Container:

Instruct students on how to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile.
Explain the process of running the container locally.
Testing:

Encourage students to test their containerized model by sending sample requests to the API endpoint.
Provide example requests and expected responses for testing.
Deployment Considerations:

Discuss considerations for deploying Docker containers in production environments, including cloud-based solutions.
Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of documenting the Dockerfile and containerization process.
Submission and Presentation:

Have students submit their Dockerized machine learning model along with a brief report or presentation explaining the project's functionality and deployment process.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful creation of a Docker image that encapsulates the machine learning model and dependencies.
Functional web service within the Docker container that accepts requests and provides model predictions.
Proper documentation of the Dockerfile and containerization process.
Testing and verification of the Dockerized model's functionality.
