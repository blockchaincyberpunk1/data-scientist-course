Model Monitoring and Scaling

Objective: To understand model maintenance and implement model monitoring for a deployed machine learning application.

Task:

In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in setting up model monitoring for a deployed machine learning application. They will implement automated monitoring solutions to track model performance and scalability, ensuring that the model continues to perform optimally in a production environment.

Instructions:

Introduction to Model Monitoring:

Explain the importance of model monitoring in maintaining machine learning applications in production.
Discuss the key metrics and aspects that need to be monitored, such as accuracy, latency, and resource utilization.
Select a Deployed Machine Learning Model:

Provide students with a deployed machine learning model from a previous assignment or a sample model.
Ensure that the model has an API for inference.
Setting Up Monitoring Infrastructure:

Instruct students to choose and set up monitoring tools or platforms suitable for the task. Common options include Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud-based monitoring services.
Define Monitoring Metrics:

Explain the types of metrics that need to be tracked, such as:
Model accuracy: Monitor how well the model is performing on incoming data.
Latency: Measure the time taken to process requests.
Resource utilization: Monitor CPU, memory, and GPU usage.
Throughput: Track the number of requests processed per unit of time.
Implement Alerts and Thresholds:

Guide students in setting up alerting mechanisms based on the defined metrics.
Students should establish thresholds that, when exceeded, trigger alerts to notify administrators of potential issues.
Scaling Strategies:

Discuss strategies for scaling the model to handle increased load. Explain concepts like load balancing and horizontal scaling.
Instruct students to implement auto-scaling mechanisms if possible.
Log Aggregation and Analysis:

Teach students how to collect and analyze logs generated by the deployed model and the monitoring tools.
Demonstrate how logs can be used to troubleshoot issues and improve model performance.
Automation and Remediation:

Encourage students to automate responses to certain types of alerts, such as scaling up resources when traffic increases.
Discuss remediation actions that can be taken automatically or with minimal human intervention.
Real-time Dashboard:

Students should create a real-time monitoring dashboard using tools like Grafana to visualize key metrics.
The dashboard should provide insights into model health and performance.
Testing:

Have students simulate various scenarios, such as increased traffic or model degradation, to ensure that the monitoring and alerting systems respond as expected.
Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of documenting the monitoring setup, including metric definitions, alerting thresholds, and scaling strategies.
Presentation and Report:

Ask students to prepare a presentation or report summarizing their model monitoring setup, including the tools used, monitored metrics, alerting mechanisms, and scaling strategies.
Evaluation Criteria:

This assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful setup of model monitoring infrastructure.
Implementation of automated alerts and threshold-based alerting.
Strategies for scaling the model based on load.
Quality of the monitoring dashboard and visualization.
Documentation of the monitoring setup and scaling strategies.
Ability to respond to simulated scenarios effectively.
