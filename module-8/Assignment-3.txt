Model Deployment with Flask

Objective: To deploy a machine learning model using Flask, a Python web framework.

Task:

In this assignment, students will gain hands-on experience in deploying a machine learning model by building a web application using Flask. They will create a simple web interface that allows users to input data, apply a pre-trained machine learning model, and display the model's predictions.

Instructions:

Introduction to Model Deployment:

Provide an overview of why model deployment is essential in real-world machine learning applications.
Explain the significance of using Flask as a web framework for deploying machine learning models.
Select a Machine Learning Model:

Provide students with a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., a classification or regression model).
Ensure that the model is suitable for the deployment task.
Set Up the Flask Application:

Guide students through the process of setting up a Flask project.
Instruct them to create a basic directory structure for the web application.
Build the Web Interface:

Encourage students to design a simple web interface with an HTML form.
Specify the input fields where users can provide data for prediction.
Model Integration:

Instruct students on how to integrate the pre-trained machine learning model into the Flask application.
Explain how to load the model and apply it to user-provided data.
Data Validation:

Guide students in implementing data validation to ensure that user input adheres to expected formats and constraints.
Provide examples of validation techniques (e.g., checking for missing values, validating data types).
Prediction Display:

Instruct students on how to display the model's predictions to the user.
Encourage them to present the results in a user-friendly format (e.g., a message or graphical visualization).
Error Handling:

Explain the importance of error handling in web applications.
Guide students in implementing error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected situations gracefully.
Testing:

Encourage students to thoroughly test their Flask application by providing sample inputs and verifying the predictions.
Deployment:

Explain different deployment options, such as local deployment or hosting the application on cloud platforms like Heroku or AWS.
Instruct students on how to prepare their application for deployment.
Documentation:

Emphasize the importance of documenting the code and deployment process for future reference.
Submission and Presentation:

Have students submit their Flask web applications along with a brief report or presentation that includes details about the model, application functionality, and deployment process.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful deployment of the pre-trained machine learning model using Flask.
User-friendly web interface with proper data validation and error handling.
Accuracy of predictions and effective display to the user.
Documentation of the code and deployment process.
Presentation of the deployed web application.
